## Outputs
None.

## Notes
â„¹ This action also checks for `composer.lock` and does a `composer validate` before running `composer install`.  
Failing these checks will result in a failed action.

**FYI**: in order to speed up the build, we create a GitHub actions cache with the following key: `composer-cache-${{ hashFiles('composer.lock') }}`.  
This means that each time a build for the same `composer.lock` happens, the data will be restored and used from cache.
