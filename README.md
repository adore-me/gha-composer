## Outputs
None.

## Notes
â„¹ This action also checks for `composer.lock` and does a `composer validate` before running `composer install`.  
Failing these checks will result in a failed action.

**FYI**: in order to speed up the build, we create a GitHub actions cache with the following key: `composer-cache-${{ hashFiles('composer.lock') }}`.  
This means that each time a build for the same `composer.lock` happens, the data will be restored and used from cache.

### Example of step configuration and usage:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: 'Run Composer Install'
    uses: adore-me/composer-action@master
    with:
      php-image-tag: SOME_IMAGE_TAG
      gh-oauth-token: ${{ secrets.GH_PRIVATE_ACTIONS_TOKEN }}
```
